How can we persuade each other to live better lives? As we struggle with our own age of ideological polarization in a fraught media ecosystem, my work examines a historical period of transformation in both religious ideas and the media through which they circulated. In early modern Europe, the addition of the movable type printing press to a media ecosystem already suffused with overlapping webs of information exchange from handwritten texts to sermons, art, plays, and pub talk amplified debates about belief and behavior and brought them to an ever-wider audience. My work attends to issues of attention, persuasion, and mobilization that remain at the center of discussions about our social media-driven media ecosystem and its social and political consequences.

I am a historian and digital humanist of religion, gender, and media in early modern Europe and a Ph.D. candidate in the History Department at Yale University. I am completing my dissertation under the joint supervision of Bruce Gordon, Carlos Eire, Paul Freedman, and Julia Burkhardt (LMU Munich). I will defend my dissertation in February 2026.
