My teaching prioritizes training students to become discerning navigators of a media ecosystem saturated with malicious political disinformation and attention-commodifying “AI slop.” In my courses, students learn to engage critically with digital tools, build their own skills of writing and historical analysis, and evaluate changes and continuities in the production and preservation of knowledge. As a teaching fellow and digital humanities lab consultant, I've learned to incorporate student-led and project-based learning into my teaching style.

In my introductory undergraduate course "Something to Say: How to Write For Yourself in an Age of Generative AI," students compare Renaissance debates about imitating Cicero to contemporary debates about the use of Generative AI. While engaging with the intellectual history of rhetoric, students practice writing-as-thinking as they draft, revise, and give constructive peer feedback. In a world dominated by ChatGPT, this course empowers students with writing skills informed by the long history of thinking about writing, the intellectual history of rhetoric. Beginning with the foundational thinkers of the ancient world, this course traces ideas about how to write through the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, where cutthroat debates about imitation and authorship parallel debates about the use of Generative AI in the present. 

In my advanced seminar "Information Revolutions: Parallels of a Print and Digital Age," students use digital humanities tools to study the information revolution of early modern Europe, comparing their own design of an online exhibit webpage with a sixteenth-century printmaker's typesetting. Students learn early modern European book history and print culture as they compare the early modern print revolution and our current digital information revolution. This course examines how early modern society grappled with misinformation, censorship, information overload, and polemical debates sparking rebellion, state violence, and genocide. Students will learn how textual, oral, and visual media intertwine to produce a media ecosystem that drives religious and cultural change, both in the early modern period and the present.
